Hello Human! This is Sai, a Machine Learning Research Engineer and technical artist based in Bangalore, working at the intersection of software development, robotics, and 3D graphics. Over the years, Iâ€™ve contributed to projects like building synthetic data pipelines, developing  plugins for Unreal Engine and Blender, and creating simulations, autonomous functions and perception modules in robotics. I teach in my spare time, and also write interactive blog posts.

Other than that, Iâ€™m deeply invested in understanding the human condition ðŸŽ­ and the expression of life in all its diverse forms ðŸŒ¸ðŸ¦Ž, exploring metaphysics ðŸ’­ and seeking ways to reduce suffering on a personal level , hoping I'd be able to also tend to others I come across ðŸ«‚.

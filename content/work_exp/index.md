## Experience  

### Machine Learning Engineer  (Clove Technologies)
*01/2024 - Present*  
- Developing ML pipelines for training and inference on 3D point clouds.  
- Created tools in Unreal Engine capable of annotating ~1e8 points in just 10 minutes, significantly improving data labeling efficiency.  
- Built visualization tools using Godot and GDExtensions for enhanced performance and usability.  

### Developer and Technical Artist  (AuraML)
*05/2023 - 01/2024*  
- Implemented a Django backend and Python module for seamless dataset processing and cloud storage integration.  
- Designed and deployed data generation pipelines in Nvidia IsaacSim using Replicator, enabling scalable and efficient workflows.  
- Developed an Unreal Engine plugin in C++ for synthetic data generation, achieving an 80% performance improvement over existing solutions.  
- Integrated domain randomization techniques using procedural textures and geometry, enhancing model accuracy by 20%.  
- Created Unreal Editor Utilities to streamline the setup of data generation environments, boosting team productivity.  

### Robotics Perception Engineer (asink.ai )
*03/2022 - 05/2023*  
- Implemented synthetic dataset generation pipeline in blender with PyBullet for generating valid collision-free scenes. 
- Led training of instance segmentation models(SOLOV2, YOLOx, Yolact) on entirely synthetic datasets, achieving a 90% accuracy on detecting kitchen utensils.
- Implemented procedural materials in blender shader graphs  for domain randomization.
- Developed localization Algorithms for cameras, end effectors, and key objects using Aruco-based pose estimation and ICP-based registration from depth streams, minimizing the localization error from ~5cm to ~1.5 cm.
- Implemented analytical and ML methods for post-processing noisy point cloud data, creating parametric models of objects with 6D orientations and grasp poses.
- Developed a python package for hierarchical transformation relationships, simplifying 6D grasp pose representation.
- Designed and implemented core automation logic for a dishwashing robot and developed a simulation system for robotic manipulation tasks using PyBullet.
- Built a tele-operation system for remote robot control using a joystick or keyboard over a gRPC channel. The application was utilized for displaying live video streams and modifying control flow as part of a human-in-the-loop process.
- Created GUI tools for debugging and inspecting model inference by varying post-processing parameters.

### Software Developer - Devops  (TCS)
*01/2021 - 02/2022*  
- Automated CI/CD pipeline components and developed SQL processing tools.  
- Created Jenkins jobs for deployment and integrated with Gitea for version control.  
- Built command-line utilities for SQL processing and Liquibase changelog generation, enhancing deployment efficiency.

### Robotics Perception Engineer (asink.ai )
*03/2022 - 05/2023*  
- Implemented synthetic dataset generation pipeline in blender with PyBullet for generating valid collision-free scenes. 
- Led training of instance segmentation models(SOLOV2, YOLOx, Yolact) on entirely synthetic datasets, achieving a 90% accuracy on detecting kitchen utensils.
- Implemented procedural materials in blender shader graphs  for domain randomization.
- Developed localization Algorithms for cameras, end effectors, and key objects using Aruco-based pose estimation and ICP-based registration from depth streams, minimizing the localization error from ~5cm to ~1.5 cm.
- Implemented analytical and ML methods for post-processing noisy point cloud data, creating parametric models of objects with 6D orientations and grasp poses.
- Developed a python package for hierarchical transformation relationships, simplifying 6D grasp pose representation.
- Designed and implemented core automation logic for a dishwashing robot and developed a simulation system for robotic manipulation tasks using PyBullet.
- Built a tele-operation system for remote robot control using a joystick or keyboard over a gRPC channel. The application was utilized for displaying live video streams and modifying control flow as part of a human-in-the-loop process.
- Created GUI tools for debugging and inspecting model inference by varying post-processing parameters.
